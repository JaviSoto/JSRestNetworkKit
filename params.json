{"body":"#JSRestNetworkKit v0.5.2\r\n**JSRestNetworkKit** is a lightweight library to manage the backend of your iOS / Mac OSX applications perfect to work against a model-based REST backend.\r\nIt's a framework written on top of [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) that allows to write the backend code of apps with very little code.\r\n\r\n##Features:\r\n- Automatic parsing of JSON just by defining your models and their properties. It allows you to map the server-side model entities to your own model classes.\r\n- **Don't code all that usual boilerplate code** any more: parsing the JSON dictionaries with ```-valueForKey:```, having to deal with crashes because of ```NSNull``` or expecting an ```NSArray``` and getting an ```NSDictionary```, ```NSArray``` out of bounds, ```-initWithCoder:``` and ```- encodeWithCoder:```... **JSRestNetworkKit takes care of all that for you**.\r\n- Implement the backend of your app and have it working (returning random data) without a working API server-side.\r\n- Caching with very little code. Make your app behave better with no connection.\r\n- Support to automatically insert parsed objects into CoreData.\r\n\r\n##Components:\r\n- ```JSRestClient```: Your entry point to make requests the API. Instantiate it with the base URL of your API, and optionally ```JSRequestSigning``` and ```JSResponseParser``` objects. Then pass ```JSRequest``` objects to execute them.\r\n- ```JSRequest```: Holds all the information about a request: type (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), the path (relative to the base URL of the Rest client), the parameters and optionally the request headers.\r\n- ```JSRequestParameters```: Wrapper on top of NSMutableDictionary to store the parameters of a request.\r\n- ```JSRequestSigning```: Protocol that you can conform to if you want to have the chance to alter a request just before it's sent off to the network. You can alter the request headers at that point, for example, to add authentication.\r\n- ```JSResponseParser```: Protocol that you can conform to if you want to help ```JSRestClient``` distinguish between a successful and a failed request depending on the content of the response. For example, checking if the JSON contains an *error* dictionary.\r\n- ```JSBaseEntity```: Class that your models must inherit from. Just implement the method ```+entityProperties``` and you get the JSON parsing for free.\r\n- ```JSBaseCoreDataBackedEntity```: Works the same as ```JSBaseEntity```, but enables you to store the objects in CoreData.\r\n- ```JSEntityProperty```: Holds the information about an entity field: key in the JSONs returned by the API, key of the property in the corresponding ```JSBaseEntity```/```JSBaseCoreDataBackedEntity``` object, type (numeric, string, relationship...) so it's parsed accordingly.\r\n\r\n##How to use it:\r\n- Clone the repo.\r\n- Update the submodules recursively:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n```\r\n- Add ```JSRestNetworkKit``` to your Xcode project.\r\n- Import ```JSRestNetworkKit.h```.\r\n- Start playing with it (check out the sample project).\r\n\r\n## Sample snippets\r\n\r\n- This sample method makes a request to twitter and shows how easy it becomes to parse the response:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)requestTwitterTimelineOfUser:(TwitterUser *)user successCallback:(TwitterRequestManagerSucessCallback)success errorCallback:(TwitterRequestManagerErrorCallback)error\r\n{\r\n    JSRequestParameters *parameters = [JSRequestParameters emptyRequestParameters];\r\n    [parameters setValue:user.userID forKey:@\"user_id\"];\r\n    \r\n    JSRequest *request = [[[JSRequest alloc] initWithType:JSRequestTypeGET path:@\"1/statuses/user_timeline.json\" parameters:parameters] autorelease];\r\n    \r\n    NSString *userCacheKey = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"twitter_user_timeline_cache_%@\", user.userID];\r\n    \r\n    [self.restClient makeRequest:request withCacheKey:userCacheKey parseBlock:^id(NSArray *tweetDictionaries) {        \r\n\t\tNSMutableArray *tweets = [NSMutableArray array];\r\n        \r\n\t    for (NSDictionary *tweetDictionary in tweetDictionaries)\r\n\t    {\r\n\t        // This is where all the magic happens: initWithDictionary works out of the box, just because we defined the properties of the class Tweet in the method +entityProperties\r\n\t        Tweet *tweet = [[Tweet alloc] initWithDictionary:tweetDictionary];\r\n\t        [tweets addObject:tweet];\r\n\t        [tweet release];\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    \r\n\t    return tweets;\r\n    } success:success error:error];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- More to come.\r\n\r\n##Status:\r\nThe status of **JSRestNetworkitKit** is *work in progress*. And you may ask yourself: *why am I sharing this if it's not finished*? Well, [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) convinced me to [embrace the suck](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/how-to-stop-sucking-and-be-awesome-instead.html).\r\nParticularly this is what I'd like to do before considering ```JSRestNetworkKit``` stable:\r\n- Some general refactoring / cleaning\r\n- Adding some unit tests\r\n- Add a Mac OSX sample app\r\n- Better (and more complete) documentation\r\n\r\n##ARC Support:\r\nJSRestNetworkKit doesn't support ARC at the moment. If you want to integrate it in your ARC project, simply add the ```-fno-objc-arc``` linker option to each of the implementation files.

A lot of this is based on previous work of his. This wouldn't have been possible without his contribution and inspiration.\r\n- [Matt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt). This wouldn't exist without [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking). I also have to thank him for encouraging me to publish this.\r\n- Want to be in this list?
